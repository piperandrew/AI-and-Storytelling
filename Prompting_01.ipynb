      "Text: This was a history lesson under erasure that translated Stalinist mass violence into late-Soviet social discipline. A full explanation of Khrushchev‚Äôs speech and its aftermath and of the social processes surrounding the history and memory of Stalinist collective violence requires the articulation of novel theoretical positions. Analyses of legacies of mass historical violence in Europe and elsewhere typically cast the social arena as a battleground between memory and oblivion, projecting psychic mechanisms associated with the aftermath of trauma‚Äîmost frequently those of repression and repetition compulsion‚Äîas metaphors for collective processes in which a society as a whole is conceived as repressing memory of past events, memory that must be brought to the fore if recovery and amelioration are to take place. Yet¬†memory,¬†forgetting, and¬†repression¬†are precisely the wrong terms for analysis of legacies of Stalinist mass violence in the USSR‚Äîand in present-day Russia as well. In this case, nothing is forgotten, and repression‚Äîwith wooden clubs or exile to the camps‚Äîbears little resemblance to repression of traumatic suffering, in which the original perception of unimaginable events is thought to remain unassimilated by memory, an inaccessible lost experience.\n",

      "Text: The text articulates for the Duchess ‚Äúa world of her own invention,‚Äù but only out of or in relation to the common words, images, and knowledge of Cavendish‚Äôs seventeenth-century England, the world of ‚Äúsensitive and rational self-moving matter‚Äù that Cavendish envisioned the earth to be. Crucially, the Duchess does not choose to make a world of philosophy or of abstracted forms, symbols, or ideas like the models she rejects, but instead a world of anthropomorphized matter, a foundational quality that renders humans and nature of the same cloth. As with all science fiction, the fantastical worlds constructed in one‚Äôs imagination only become coherent when expressed in fragments of common knowledge: Huxley‚Äôs flying cars in Brave New World are cars nevertheless, just like the purplish complexions of the beast-men in the Blazing World are only comprehensible to the Empress in terms of the skin colors of her native world. That the semiotics of science fiction works this way is not new; but that Cavendish chooses anthropomorphism in The Blazing World (and in Observations) as a distinct method for acknowledging and describing the ways in which nature is already animated is highly relevant to our contemporary studies of both the Anthropocene and Cavendish. Though one of the most formidable challenges for natural philosophers in Cavendish‚Äôs early modern England was to systematize experimentation such that experimental science could more reliably earn Sprat‚Äôs rhetorical claim to ‚ÄúReal Knowledge,‚Äù perhaps one of the most formidable challenges of the Anthropocene age is to rethink the kind of ‚ÄúReal Knowledge‚Äù that positions nature as an inanimate object in relation to the human subject, and thus to learn how to articulate our world as animated with us, not in opposition to us.\n"

      "After his mother rescues him, he joins his swarm of siblings flying above and is bumped and jostled. Skinny even by mosquito standards, and fearing he will end up doused again, Dinnn decides he would rather walk than fly.,This decision inevitably leads to Dinnn‚Äôs being taunted by older mosquitos and largely forgotten by his family. The ridicule intensifies when Dinnn finds a tiny, discarded motorcycle jacket (with ‚ÄúWasp Brothers‚Äù inscribed on the back), which he takes to wearing over his unused wings.,Dinnn is put into a situation that forces him to ditch his jacket and take flight, which allows him to tag along with the rest of his family as they hitch a ride in a minivan to the ‚Äúwild,‚Äù where his mother came from, and where his half-brother still resides.,The transition from the first part of the narrative to the latter sections (after Dinnn learns to fly) is less smooth than it could be. The young bug‚Äôs fear of flying is suddenly and easily resolved, and lends a note of finality to the tale.

      "Resolving to dance at an upcoming powwow, John finds a way to stand up for himself so he can keep dancing and playing soccer.,John is an appealing character, a passionate teenager who works hard at both his prevailing interests. While he becomes a great dancer a little too quickly, his initial struggles are entertaining and realistic. Scenes between him and his parents and energetic younger sister, Jen, are especially well drawn, and the book‚Äôs supportive family dynamic contrasts well with the racism and conflict mentioned elsewhere. John‚Äôs relationships with his friends, however, are lacking, and more space could have been devoted to his friendship with soccer teammate Aiden, who is understanding of John‚Äôs choices but is an otherwise flat character.,While the book is not overly focused on racism, passing mention of some of John and Jen‚Äôs negative experiences, and acknowledgement of topics like cultural appropriation, help ground the story without feeling heavy handed. ,He Who Dreams, offers readers a fast-paced story with realistic indigenous content, connecting the book to contemporary discussions about indigenous issues in Canada.\n",

They exist only _durcheinander_. Reality always is, in M. Bergson's phrase, an endosmosis or conflux of the same with the different: they compenetrate and telescope.\n",
