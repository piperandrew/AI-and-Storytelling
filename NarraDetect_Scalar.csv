A full explanation of Khrushchev’s speech and its aftermath and of the social processes surrounding the history and memory of Stalinist collective violence requires the articulation of novel theoretical positions. Analyses of legacies of mass historical violence in Europe and elsewhere typically cast the social arena as a battleground between memory and oblivion, projecting psychic mechanisms associated with the aftermath of trauma—most frequently those of repression and repetition compulsion—as metaphors for collective processes in which a society as a whole is conceived as repressing memory of past events, memory that must be brought to the fore if recovery and amelioration are to take place. Yet memory, forgetting, and repression are precisely the wrong terms for analysis of legacies of Stalinist mass violence in the USSR—and in present-day Russia as well. In this case, nothing is forgotten, and repression—with wooden clubs or exile to the camps—bears little resemblance to repression of traumatic suffering, in which the original perception of unimaginable events is thought to remain unassimilated by memory, an inaccessible lost experience.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,2.666666667,1.333333333,2.333333333,2,1.888888889,0.5925925927,0,0,2 4 3,3,0.0096129448659698,0.005576551,0.007812381,1 2 1,1.33333333333333,0,0,0,0,0

That the semiotics of science fiction works this way is not new; but that Cavendish chooses anthropomorphism in The Blazing World (and in Observations) as a distinct method for acknowledging and describing the ways in which nature is already animated is highly relevant to our contemporary studies of both the Anthropocene and Cavendish.

Endpoints DFT provides a framework for computing solvation free energies by combining molecular simulations with a version of the classical density-functional theory of solutions which focuses on., the indirect (solvent-mediated) part of the solute-solvent potential of mean force (indirect PMF). The simulations are performed at the endpoints of a hypothetical charging process which transforms the solvent density from the pure liquid state to that of the solution state. The endpoints DFT expression for solvation free energy can be shown to be equivalent to the standard expression for which the key quantity is the direct correlation function, but it has the advantage that the indirect term. is more focused on the change in solvent-solvent correlations with respect to the pure liquid as the solute is inserted into the solution. In this Perspective, we review recent developments of endpoints DFT, highlighting a series of papers we have written together beginning in 2017. We emphasize the importance of dimensionality reduction as the key to the evaluation of endpoints DFT expressions and present a recently developed, spatially resolved version of the theory. The role of interfacial water at certain positions which stabilize or destabilize a solute in solution can be analyzed with the spatially resolved version, and it is of considerable interest to investigate how changes in solvation affect protein-ligand binding and conformational landscapes from an endpoints DFT perspective. Endpoints DFT can also be employed in materials science; an example involving the rational design strategy for polymer membrane separation is described. The endpoints DFT method is a scheme to evaluate the solvation free energy by introducing approximations to integrate the classical density functional over a charging parameter.

A comprehensive understanding of this complicated material system is still quite lacking. The objective of this study is to use mesoscale finite element simulation to gain insights on the reinforcing efficiencies of different types of carbon nanofillers as distinguished by their geometries and interfacial strengths. It is demonstrated that CNT (carbon nanotube) and CNF (carbon nanofiber) have larger load carrying capacity and potentially higher reinforcing efficiency than GNP (graphite nanoplatelet) due to their larger aspect ratio and physical length. However, the higher load carrying capacity is also associated with higher interfacial stress which can lead to earlier debonding, particularly for CNT. GNP, on the other hand, has lower load carrying capacity, and is thus less sensitive to the bonding condition and less susceptible to debonding. The overall reinforcing efficiency is a manifestation of the interplay between the load carrying capacity of the filler, which is limited by filler's geometry, and the load transfer capability at the interface, which is limited by the filler/matrix interfacial strength. This interplay is also reflected in the effects of filler orientation on reinforcing efficiency.

Gel formulations are among the most suitable dosage forms for topical use to treat cutaneous infection. Nanotechnology is a promising approach to penetrate the deeper skin layers and enhance permeability of itraconazole (ITZ) through the stratum corneum. ITZ-loaded nanoparticles (ITZ NPs) were fabricated using the evaporation emulsion method, followed by incorporation of NPs into gel using Carbopol 934 as the gel-forming excipient. The physical properties, in vitro release, ex vivo permeation studies, and antifungal activity of ITZ NP gel were characterized. ITZ NPs were almost spherical in shape with colloidal sizes in the range of 200 nm. The drug encapsulation efficiency was 98.79 +/- 1.24%. ITZ NP gel demonstrated a sustained ex vivo permeation of ITZ over 24 h through excised rat skin and a higher drug penetrating capacity than that of a gel containing ITZ-saturated suspension. The in vitro antifungal activity of the ITZ-loaded NP incorporated gel was better than that of ITZ dispersion.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_157.txt,"Objective Few studies have examined lockdown effects on the way of living and well-being of older adults stratified by cognitive state. Since cognitive deficits are common in this population, we investigated how cognition influenced their understanding of the pandemic, socio-behavioral responses and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown, and how these factors affected their mood or memory. Method Telephone-based survey involving 204 older adults >= 65 y/o (median: 82) with previous assessments of cognitive state: 164 normal-old (NOLD), 24 mild-neurocognitive disorder (mild-NCD), 18 mild-moderate dementia. A structured questionnaire was developed to assess psychological and socio-behavioral variables. Logistic regression was used to ascertain their effects on mood and memory. Results With increasing cognitive deficits, understanding of the pandemic and the ability to follow lockdown policies, adapt to lifestyle changes, and maintain remote interactions decreased. Participants with dementia were more depressed; NOLDs remained physically and mentally active but were more bored and anxious. Sleeping and health problems independently increased the likelihood of depression (OR: 2.29; CI: 1.06-4.93; p = 0.034 and OR: 2.45; CI: 1.16-5.16; p = 0.018, respectively); Regular exercise was protective (OR: 0.30; CI: 0.12-0.72; p = 0.007). Worsening subjective memory complaints were associated with dementia (p = 0.006) and depression (p = 0.004); New-onset sleeping problems raised their odds (OR: 10.26; CI: 1.13-93.41; p = 0.039). Finally, >40% with health problems avoided healthcare mainly due to fear of contagion.

The role of LACTB in PINO treatment was investigated by transfection of siRNA-LACTB. Cell counting kit-8 assay, wound healing assay, and Transwell assay were conducted to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of CRC cells, respectively. Western blot or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out to measure the expressions of LACTB, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. Results: Gradient PINO inhibited the viability, migration, invasiveness, and expressions of MMP-2 and N-cadherin in CRC cells, while promoted E-cadherin and LACTB expressions. Silencing LACTB promoted the viability, migration, invasiveness, and expressions of MMP-2 and N-cadherin in CRC cells and inhibited E-cadherin expression.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_341.txt,"The effects of cold plasma on the enzymatic activity, color, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of avocado pulp with lime extract (PL) and without extract (PW) were studied. The experimental conditions applied varied with regard to time (10, 20, and 30 min) and gas flow (10, 20, and 30 ml). The gas flow combination of 20 ml/20 min applied in PL was efficient for reducing POD and PPO activities and browning index as well as for color maintenance. Cold plasma increased the phenolic and carotenoid levels in PW in T1 and T2 (gas flow 10 ml/10-30 min) and in PL in T3 and T8 (gas flow 30 ml/10 min and 20 ml/30 min), which contributed to the improvement in antioxidant activity. The phenolic showed a strong correlation with ORAC-H in PL (0.85) and PW (0.75). Myristic and palmitic acid were reduced after applying cold plasma, however, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic increased the content. It is concluded that the synergistic effect of lime extract in avocado pulp with cold plasma technology is efficient at maintaining the quality characteristics and improving the bioactive content.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_43.txt,"Background: The recent widespread availability of augmented reality via smartphone offers an opportunity to translate cue exposure therapy for smoking cessation from the laboratory to the real world. Despite significant reductions in the smoking rates in the last decade, approximately 13.7% of the adults in the United States continue to smoke. Smoking-related cue exposure has demonstrated promise as an adjuvant therapy in the laboratory, but practical limitations have prevented its success in the real world. Augmented reality technology presents an innovative approach to overcome these limitations. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a smartphone app that presents smoking-related augmented reality images for cue exposure. Smokers provided feedback on the images and reported on the perceived urge to smoke, qualities of reality/coexistence, and general feedback about quality and functioning. The feedback was used to refine the augmented reality images within the app. Methods: In collaboration with an augmented reality design company, we developed 6 smoking-related images (cigarette, lighter, ashtray, lit cigarette in ashtray, etc) and 6 neutral images similar in size or complexity for comparison (pen, eraser, notebook, soda bottle with droplets, etc). Ten smokers completed a survey of demographic characteristics, smoking history and behavior, dependence on nicotine, motivation to quit smoking, and familiarity with augmented reality technology. Then, participants viewed each augmented reality image and provided ratings on 10-point Likert scales for urge to smoke and reality/coexistence of the image into the scene. Participants were also queried with open-ended questions regarding the features of the images. Results: Of the 10 participants, 5 (50%) had experienced augmented reality prior to the laboratory visit, but only 4 of those 5 participants used augmented reality at least weekly. Although the sample was small (N=10), smokers reported significantly higher urge to smoke after viewing the smoking-related augmented reality images (median 4.58, SD 3.49) versus the neutral images (median 1.42, SD 3.01) (Z=-2.14, P=.03; d=0.70). The average reality and coexistence ratings of the images did not differ between smoking-related and neutral images (all P>.29). Augmented reality images were found on average to be realistic (mean [SD] score 6.49 [3.11]) and have good environmental coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.93 [3.04]) and user coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.38 [3.27]) on the 10-point scale. Participant interviews revealed some areas of excellence (eg, details of the lit cigarette) and areas for improvement (eg, stability of images, lighting). Conclusions: All images were generally perceived as being realistic and well-integrated into the environment. However, the smoking augmented reality images produced higher urge to smoke than the neutral augmented reality images.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_440.txt,"Purpose This research investigated whether structuring an inquiry-oriented professional learning network to include school-based co-teaching partners would amplify educators' success in taking up and adapting evidence-based understandings and practices as meaningful in their contexts. Our research questions were: (1) What conditions did educators identify in the PLN overall that supported their co-construction of knowledge and practice development together? and (2) How did including co-teaching partners in the PLN help participants to mobilize knowledge and/or practices in the contexts where they were working? Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study design was used because of its potential to examine how and why questions about complex processes as situated in context (Butler, 2011; Yin, 2014). A case study methodology allowed us to collect and coordinate multiple forms of evidence (i.e. interviews, teacher reflective writing, classroom artifacts, field notes) to examine both how conditions created within the PLN supported learning and how co-teaching partners were mobilizing what they were learning in their school contexts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data was analyzed abductively through an iterative and recursive process (Braun et al., 2018). Findings Conditions within the PLN overall that participants identified as supportive to their knowledge mobilization and practice development included: having a shared focus, feeling accountability to the group, collaborative enactment of practices within the PLN, large group sharing and debriefing, sustained cycles of collaborative inquiry, affective support, valuing diversity and drawing from expert others as resources. Participants also identified the benefits that accrued specifically from working with co-teaching partners. In addition, findings showed how the degree to which partners engaged in rich forms of collaborative inquiry could be related to their learning and situated practice development. Originality/value Findings show the generative potential of inviting co-teaching partners into a PLN to engage in collaborative inquiry with others. PLNs offer the benefit of engaging with educators from outside of one's practice context, which enables pushing their thinking in new directions. Our findings add to the literature by revealing how in situ knowledge mobilization can be amplified when educators participating within a PLN are also working through cycles of inquiry with a co-teaching partner.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_558.txt,"Aims/Introduction Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy and is associated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and aberrant glycolysis. Dimeric pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 (PKM2) acts as a key protein kinase in aberrant glycolysis by promoting the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, while tetrameric PKM2 functions as a pyruvate kinase in oxidative phosphorylation. The aim of the research is to study the effect of PKM2 tetramer activation on preventing kidney fibrosis via suppression of aberrant glycolysis and the EMT program. Materials and methods In vivo: Streptozotocin (STZ) was utilized to induce diabetes in 8-week-old CD-1 mice; 4 weeks after diabetes induction, proteinuria-induced kidney fibrosis was developed by intraperitoneal injection of bovine serum albumin (BSA: 0.3 g/30 g BW) for 14 days; The PKM2 activator TEPP-46 was also administered orally simultaneously. In vitro: HK2 cells were co-treated with high-glucose media or/and TGF-beta 1 and TEPP46 for 48 h, cellular protein was extracted for evaluation. Results Diabetic mice developed kidney fibrosis associated with aberrant glycolysis and EMT; BSA injection accelerated kidney fibrosis in both the control and diabetic mice; TEPP-46 rescued the kidney fibrosis. In HK2 cells, TEPP-46 suppressed the EMT program induced by TGF-beta 1 and/or high-glucose incubation. TEPP-46-induced PKM2 tetramer formation and PK activity resulted in suppression of HIF-1 alpha and lactate accumulation. Specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1 alpha expression diminished high glucose-induced mesenchymal protein levels.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_574.txt,"MicroRNA (miR)-141-3p, which functions as an oncogene in multiple malignancies, has been shown to be highly overexpressed in esophageal cancer cells in our previous work. miR-141-3p is predicted to bind the messenger RNA (mRNA) of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), a tumor suppressor, with high affinity. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional interaction between miR-141-3p and TSC1 in esophageal cancer cells. Experiments were conducted in four esophageal cancer lines and in tumor cells isolated from human esophageal cancer specimens by laser capture microdissection. miR-141-3p expression was measured by real time and droplet digital PCR. Biotinylated RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays were used to assess binding. miR-141-3p function was tested by assessing proliferation, migration, invasion, and induction of autophagy following its silencing. We found that miR-141-3p levels were increased in TE7, OE33, and TE10 esophageal cancer cells compared to FLO-1 cells, with similar heterogeneity observed in human esophageal cancer specimens. Silencing of miR-141-3p led to increased TSC1 protein expression in these cells and was associated with increased TSC1 translation. Binding studies reveal that miR-141-3p binds to each of the predicted binding sites in the 3 '-untranslated region of TSC1 mRNA. Following miR-141-3p silencing, TE7, OE33, and TE10 cells exhibited decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as enhanced autophagy. Importantly, these phenotypic effects were replicated by overexpression of TSC1 alone in these cells.

Design: Cross-sectional survey based on components of the Health Belief Model Setting: Administered in-person at a Franco-American cultural center and online through mailing lists and social media platforms in the Northeastern United States Sample: Franco-Americans and French Canadians (n = 170) Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics (i.e. high cholesterol, prior heart attack or stroke, family history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diagnosis of FH), perceived barriers to accessing health care services, self-efficacy, and health-promoting behaviors (i.e. taking lipid-lowering medications, seeing a cardiovascular specialist). Results: In a cohort of Franco-Americans, 42 (25%) had both high cholesterol and family history of ASCVD. Among Franco-Americans with both cardiovascular risk factors, 22% had low self-efficacy and only 16% had discussed FH with their physician. Individuals with both risk factors were significantly more likely to report a concern over a future diagnosis as a barrier to accessing health care services when compared with those with neither risk factor (36% vs. 15%, p = 0.014).

Entry of FA into the human body can have adverse effects on human health, depending on the FA concentration. Thus, a quantitative analysis of FA in blood is necessary in order to estimate its effect on the human body. In this study, a simple and rapid analytical method for the quantitation of FA in blood was developed. The total analysis time, including the pretreatment procedure, was less than 20 min. To ensure a stable analysis, blood samples were stabilized using tripotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution, and FA was selectively derivatized using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as pretreatment procedures. The pretreated samples were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-UV system, which is the most common choice for analyzing small-molecule aldehydes like formaldehyde. Verification of the pretreatment methods (stabilization and derivatization) using FA standards confirmed that the pretreatment methods are highly reliable in the calibration range 0.012-5.761 ng mu L-1 (slope = 684,898, R-2 = 0.9998, and limit of detection = 0.251 pg center dot mu L-1). Analysis of FA in the blood samples of a Yucatan minipig using the new method revealed an average FA concentration of 1.98 0.34 ng mu L-1 (n = 3). Blood samples spiked with FA standards were analyzed, and the FA concentrations were found to be similar to the theoretical concentrations (2.16 0.81% difference).

Methods: The patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 10(9)/L) following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA from January 2010 to December 2018 in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected. And the high-risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of severe thrombocytopenia were analyzed. Results: A total of 1,581 children with transcatheter occlusion of a PDA were collected; 22 (1.39%) of the enrolled patients had severe thrombocytopenia. Further data analysis showed that the median diameter of PDA (6.7 [IQR: 1.63]) mm in children with severe thrombocytopenia was significantly larger than that in children without severe thrombocytopenia (3.6 +/- 1.7 mm, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the incidence of thrombocytopenia in children with residual shunt after operation (10.9%) was significantly higher than that in children without residual shunt (0.2%, p < 0.001). The mean time of thrombocytopenia was found to be 2.4 +/- 1.3 days after intervention. All patients with thrombocytopenia were treated by methylprednisolone with or without platelet transfusion and recovered without major organ hemorrhage. Conclusions: Severe thrombocytopenia following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA may be related to the larger diameter of PDA and residual shunt.

This survey's foremost objective is to find the optimum attack angle for the highest heat transfer performance in the studied geometry. The attained results demonstrated that the Rayleigh number's augmentation leads to buoyancy force amplification and intensification of velocity components in the enclosure. Hence, the shapes of streamlines for each attack angle are different from the other states. The enhancement of the Rayleigh number causes better temperature distribution between cold and hot sources. The attack angle changes are the other factor for creating and intensity of the temperature gradients. By increasing the attack angle when the heat is transferred from the hot source to the top of the enclosure, the thermal distribution effects come with high gradients due to the flow balance disturbance and the changes in two sources' location. As the fluid moves, velocity components always change. In Rayleigh number of Ra = 1 x 10(3) due to a decrease of buoyancy force and negligible density changes in the enclosure, the average friction coefficient (C-fave) is not considerable, and for everyone studied attack angles, these changes are negligible.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_931.txt,"Background Usutu virus (USUV) is a rapidly spreading zoonotic arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) and a considerable threat to the global avifauna and in isolated cases to human health. It is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as vectors and birds as reservoir hosts. Despite massive die-offs in wild bird populations and the detection of severe neurological symptoms in infected humans, little is known about which mosquito species are involved in the propagation of USUV. Methods In the present study, the vector competence of a German (i.e. ""Central European"") and a Serbian (i.e. ""Southern European"") Culex pipiens biotype molestus laboratory colony was experimentally evaluated. For comparative purposes, Culex torrentium, a frequent species in Northern Europe, and Aedes aegypti, a primarily tropical species, were also tested. Adult female mosquitoes were exposed to bovine blood spiked with USUV Africa 2 and subsequently incubated at 25 degrees C. After 2 to 3 weeks saliva was collected from each individual mosquito to assess the ability of a mosquito species to transmit USUV. Results Culex pipiens biotype molestus mosquitoes originating from Germany and the Republic of Serbia and Cx. torrentium mosquitoes from Germany proved competent for USUV, as indicated by harboring viable virus in their saliva 21 days post infection. By contrast, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were relatively refractory to an USUV infection, exhibiting low infection rates and lacking virus in their saliva. Conclusions Consistent with the high prevalences and abundances of Cx. pipiens biotype molestus and Cx. torrentium in Central and Northern Europe, these two species have most likely played a historic role in the spread, maintenance, and introduction of USUV into Germany.

Readers who embark on the journey hoping to find meaning and moments of human connection will need to persevere through Tim’s pensive musings until he himself finds meaning and connection.

The essays – of varying quality and usefulness – all suffer from one major problem: the MPs writing each piece equate the ills facing our democracy with their own complaints about their workplace. The issues plaguing the way Canada’s parliament works, however, run deeper than the largely cosmetic changes suggested here. And some of the prescriptions, especially related to decorum and the structure of Question Period, have the potential to actually be counterproductive for citizens and voters.,Nathan Cullen, an MP from the riding of Skeena–Bulkley Valley in B.C., provides a well-written call to have parliamentarians speak extemporaneously in the house instead of relying on prepared scripts. While this may make for a more engaging (and occasionally cringeworthy) discourse, it won’t do anything to improve anyone’s lot in life.,Michael Chong, the democratic-reform-minded MP for Wellington–Halton Hills (and recent failed Conservative leadership candidate), suggests shaking up the committee system, an idea that could possibly bring some new voices to those bodies, but is unlikely to make much of a substantive difference if the range of people elected to the house as a whole doesn’t become more diverse.,Liberal MP Anita Vandenbeld’s suggestions for helping more women win elections are all very practical, reasonable, and worthy of support, but are symptomatic of historic inequities and prejudices in the society that every parliament in the history of the country has, to varying degrees, perpetuated or reinforced.,The suggestions contained in ,Turning Parliament Inside Out,, if implemented, might nominally improve the working lives of the people who serve in the House of Commons.",4,3,3,3.333333333,2,1,2,1.666666667,3,3,2,2.666666667,3,2.333333333,2.333333333,2.555555556,0.5925925923,0,0,4 3 4,3.66666666666667,0.0821426067843843,0.010738134,0.00415343,4 2 2,2.66666666666667,0,0,0,0,0

Russian liberal nationalists and pan-Slavs were likely to favour a forward policy on the Turkish Straits and a posture of solidarity with the Slavic ‘little brothers’ on the Balkan peninsula. Conservatives, by contrast, tended to be acutely aware of Russia’s inner political and financial weakness and the dangers – as Kokovtsov put it – of pursuing ‘an active foreign policy at the expense of the peasant’s stomach’; they therefore favoured a policy of peace at all costs.49

When the significance of the Bosnian annexation crisis was debated in the Duma in the spring of 1909, for example, the conservative interests represented in the Council of the United Nobility argued that the annexation had in no way damaged Russian interests or security and that Russia should adopt a policy of complete non-interference in Balkan affairs, while seeking reconciliation with Berlin. The real enemy, they argued, was Britain, which was trying to push Russia into a war with Germany in order to consolidate British control of world markets. Against this position, the pro-French and pro-British liberals of the Constitutional Democrat (Cadet) Party called for the transformation of the Triple Entente into a Triple Alliance that would enable Russia to project power in the Balkan region and arrest the decline of its great power status.50 This was one of the central problems confronting all the foreign policy executives (and those who try to understand them today): the ‘national interest’ was not an objective imperative pressing in upon government from the world outside, but the projection of particular interests within the political elite itself.51

His eyes looked dull, extinguished, Wesley said to Xavier, but Betsy said his face, not just his eyes, looked soulful, warm; whatever is there, said Kate, I’ve never been so aware of his eyes; and Stephen said, I’m afraid of what my eyes show, the way I watch him, with too much intensity, or a phony kind of casualness, said Victor. And, unlike at home, he was clean-shaven each morning, at whatever hour they visited him; his curly hair was always combed; but he complained that the nurses had changed since he was here the last time, and that he didn’t like the change, he wanted everyone to be the same. The room was furnished now with some of his personal effects (odd word for one’s things, said Ellen), and Tanya brought drawings and a letter from her nine-year-old dyslexic son, who was writing now, since she’d purchased a computer; and Donny brought champagne and some helium balloons, which were anchored to the foot of his bed; tell me about something that’s going on, he said, waking up from a nap to find Donny and Kate at the side of his bed, beaming at him; tell me a story, he said wistfully, said Donny, who couldn’t think of anything to say; you’re the story, Kate said.

He lay in his reclining chair, barely awake enough to feel the dream moving just under his thoughts. It felt like one of those pure, beautiful dreams in which he was young again, and filled with the realization that the friends who had died, or gone away, or decided that they didn’t like him anymore, had really been there all along, loving him. A piece of the dream flickered, and he made out the lips and cheekbones of a tender woman, smiling as she leaned toward him. The phone rang, and the sound rippled through his pliant wakefulness, into the pending dream. But his wife had turned the answering machine up too loud again, and it attacked him with a garbled, furred roar that turned into the voice of his friend Norm.",5,5,5,5,4,3,3,3.333333333,5,5,5,5,4.666666667,4.333333333,4.333333333,4.444444444,0.740740741,1,1,4 5 4,4.33333333333333,0.998069253177667,0.999578178,0.99724704,5 4 5,4.66666666666667,1,1,1,1,1
